## What You Need Before Starting

- **Node.js** version 18 or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installing Prerequisites

**Windows:**

1. Download Node.js from <https://nodejs.org/> (choose the LTS version)
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. Download Git from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
4. Run the Git installer with default settings

**Mac:**

1. Install Homebrew if you don't have it: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2. Install Node.js: `brew install node`
3. Install Git: `brew install git`

## Getting the App Running

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Socialgirl.git
cd Socialgirl/socialgirl-app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all the required packages (might take a minute or two).

### Step 3: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Open in Browser

Once you see output like:

```
  VITE v6.3.5  ready in 500 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Open your web browser and go to: **<http://localhost:5173>**


## Stopping the App

Press `Ctrl + C` (Windows) or `Cmd + C` (Mac) in the terminal where the app is running.

## Troubleshooting

**"npm: command not found"**

- Make sure Node.js is installed and restart your terminal

**"npm install" fails**

- Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then try `npm install` again

**App won't start**

- Make sure port 5173 is not being used by another application
- Try `npm run dev -- --port 3000` to use a different port

**Need API Keys?**

- The app works with demo data by default
- To use real data, you'll need API keys from YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok
- Add them in the Settings page once the app is running
