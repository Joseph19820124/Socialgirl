Based on our conversation and the successful implementation, update the README.md file to document this solution for future reference. Follow these guidelines:

1. Identify What Was Solved

Extract the core problem that was addressed
Note the symptoms/errors that indicated this problem
Identify the root cause discovered

2. Document the Solution Pattern
Create or update a section in the following format:
markdown## [Problem Category]: [Specific Issue]

**Symptoms:**
- [List observable symptoms/errors]
- [Include error messages if applicable]

**Root Cause:**
[Explain why this problem occurs]

**Solution:**
[Step-by-step implementation that worked]

**Code Pattern:**
```[language]
// Working implementation
[Include minimal, reusable code snippet]
Key Points:

[Critical things to remember]
[Common pitfalls to avoid]
[Why this approach works]

Applicable To:

Language: [e.g., TypeScript, Python]
Frameworks: [if specific to certain frameworks]
Use Cases: [when to apply this solution]


### 3. Update Rules
- **ONLY** update sections related to what was just implemented/fixed
- **REPLACE** existing non-working solutions for the same problem
- **PRESERVE** all other unrelated sections
- **ADD** new sections if this problem hasn't been documented before

### 4. Make It Reusable
- Write solutions generically (not specific to one codebase)
- Use placeholders like `[your-variable]` instead of specific names
- Focus on the pattern, not the specific implementation details
- Include enough context for an AI assistant to apply it elsewhere

### 5. Searchability
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include common error messages in the symptoms
- Tag with relevant keywords

### Example Update:

```markdown
## State Management: React useState Not Updating Immediately

**Symptoms:**
- State appears to be "one step behind"
- Console.log shows old value after setState
- UI doesn't update as expected

**Root Cause:**
setState is asynchronous and batched in React. Accessing state immediately after setting returns the old value.

**Solution:**
Use useEffect to respond to state changes, or use the callback pattern.

**Code Pattern:**
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - Won't work
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
  console.log(count); // Still shows old value
};

// ✅ Correct - Use effect for side effects
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(count); // Shows updated value
}, [count]);

// ✅ Correct - Use callback for derived state
setCount(prevCount => {
  const newCount = prevCount + 1;
  console.log(newCount); // Can use new value
  return newCount;
});
Key Points:

Never rely on state immediately after setting it
Use useEffect for side effects based on state changes
Use callback pattern when new state depends on previous

Applicable To:

Language: TypeScript/JavaScript
Frameworks: React
Use Cases: Any React state management
